Make sure to do this before deploying:
*** first, this compose file should be used in a swarm with two nodes;
*** to run the get-ip script, the hosts can't have the same hostname (since we are running several instances of the same vm, all of them are named "gerencia-VirtualBox")
*** before deploying, create "/docker/appdata/firefox" in the worker node

I'll be working in fixing these :)
